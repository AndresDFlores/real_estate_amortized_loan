# real_estate_amortized_loan
Calculate an amortized loan based on loan parameters, generate an amortization scheduled, and visualize the loan's life


Open 'main.py' and update variables prices = [], loan_terms = [], percent_down = [] by inserting desired parameters in their respective lists.

The tool iterates through each input variable and will generate an amortization schedule and visualizations for every possible combination.
